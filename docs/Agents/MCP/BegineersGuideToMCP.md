### What is MCP and Its Background?

MCP, or Model Context Protocol, is an open standard that helps AI applications, especially large language models (LLMs), connect with external data sources and tools. Think of it like a universal adapter for AI, making it easier for systems like chatbots or coding assistants to access files, APIs, or databases without custom setups for each. It was introduced by Anthropic, a company focused on AI, around November 2024, to solve the problem of AI being isolated from data, which often limits its usefulness.

### How to Use It and Why It Matters

You can use MCP with tools like Cursor, an AI-powered code editor, and Claude, an AI model by Anthropic, by setting up MCP servers within their applications. For example, in Claude Desktop, you edit a configuration file to add servers, while in Cursor, you go to the MCP settings to add new servers. This setup lets AI perform tasks like reading files or querying databases directly.

MCP is important because it breaks down data silos, making AI more connected and efficient. It allows developers to build smarter AI systems that scale better, which is especially helpful in fields like software development or data analysis. However, its adoption is still in early stages, with some controversy around how widely it's supported across different platforms.

### List of Open-Source Servers and Building Your Own

There are several open-source MCP servers you can use, such as:

- Python SDK ([Model Context Protocol Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk))
- ChatSum, for summarizing chat messages
- Chroma, for semantic document search
- ClaudePost, for Gmail management

To build your own MCP server, start by checking the official documentation at [Model Context Protocol Introduction](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). It guides you through using SDKs in languages like Python or Java, defining what your server does, and testing it with clients like Claude Desktop. This process might require some coding knowledge, but it's designed to be accessible with the right resources.

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Model Context Protocol

This section provides a detailed exploration of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), covering its definition, origin, functionality, importance, available open-source servers, integration with Cursor and Claude, and a step-by-step guide for building your own server. The analysis is based on recent online resources, reflecting the state as of February 25, 2025, and aims to offer a professional, thorough overview for readers interested in AI integration.

### Understanding MCP: Definition and Origin

MCP, or Model Context Protocol, is an open protocol designed to standardize how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). It acts as a universal interface, likened to a USB-C port for AI, enabling seamless connections to data sources and tools. This standardization addresses the challenge of AI models being isolated from data, trapped behind information silos and legacy systems, as noted in Anthropic's introduction ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol | Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)).

The protocol was introduced by Anthropic, PBC, on November 24, 2024, as an open-source initiative to simplify AI integrations. Its development was motivated by the need for a universal standard to replace fragmented, custom implementations, allowing developers to focus on building smarter, scalable AI systems. This origin is detailed in community discussions and official documentation, such as [Getting Started: Model Context Protocol | Medium](https://medium.com/@kenzic/getting-started-model-context-protocol-e0a80dddff80), highlighting its early adoption by companies like Block and Apollo.

### Functionality: What MCP Does

MCP operates on a client-server architecture, where MCP hosts (e.g., Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools) connect to MCP servers that expose specific capabilities. These servers can provide:

- **Prompts**: Pre-defined templates guiding LLM interactions.
- **Resources**: Structured data or content for additional context.
- **Tools**: Executable functions for actions like fetching data or executing code.

This is outlined in the specification ([Server Features – Model Context Protocol Specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/server/)), which details how servers enable rich interactions. For instance, MCP allows AI to access local files, query databases, or integrate with APIs, enhancing real-time data access and workflow automation. Its flexibility is evident in supporting multiple transports (e.g., stdio, sse) and a growing list of pre-built integrations, as seen in [Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

### Importance: Why MCP Matters

MCP is crucial for breaking down data silos, a significant barrier in AI development. By providing a standardized way to connect AI with data, it enhances scalability and efficiency, reducing the need for custom integrations. This is particularly valuable in enterprise settings, where AI needs to interact with content repositories, business tools, and development environments. Early adopters, including development tools like Zed and Replit, are integrating MCP to improve context-aware coding, as noted in Anthropic's announcement ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol | Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)).

Its importance also lies in security and flexibility. MCP follows best practices for securing data within infrastructure, ensuring controlled access, and allows switching between LLM providers without reconfiguring integrations. However, its adoption is still evolving, with some debate around support for remote hosts, currently in active development, as mentioned in [For Server Developers - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server).
