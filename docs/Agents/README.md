- Resource management
- Tool chain orchestration

### 3. 📋 Planning and Strategy

Master strategic decision-making and task planning for autonomous agents.

- Goal decomposition
- Action sequence planning
- Resource allocation
- Risk assessment
- Adaptive planning strategies

### 4. 🤝 Multi-Agent Systems

Learn to implement collaborative AI systems where multiple agents work together to achieve complex goals.

- Agent communication protocols
- Task distribution and coordination
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Emergent behavior management

## 🚀 Practical Projects

### Multi-Document Agents
