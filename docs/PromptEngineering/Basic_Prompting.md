# Basic Prompting Techniques: A Practical Guide

## Introduction

Prompt engineering is the art of crafting effective instructions for AI models. This guide covers fundamental techniques that will help you get better results from AI interactions.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

The simplest form of prompting - just ask directly without examples.

**What it is:**

- Direct questions or instructions
- No additional context needed
- Quick and straightforward

**Example:**

```
❌ Complex: Please tell me, if you would be so kind, what the capital of France might be?
✅ Simple: What is the capital of France?
```

### 2. One-Shot Prompting

Providing one example to guide the AI's response.

**What it is:**

- Single example + new request
- Helps establish format/style
- More precise than zero-shot

**Example:**

```
Product Description Example:
"The Classic White Mug - A timeless 12oz ceramic mug perfect for your morning coffee. Microwave-safe and dishwasher-friendly."

Please write a similar description for: Gaming Mechanical Keyboard
```

### 3. Few-Shot Prompting

Multiple examples for more complex tasks.

**What it is:**

- Several examples before the request
- Creates clear patterns
- Best for consistent outputs

**Example:**

```
Convert these sentences to past tense:
Input: "I eat an apple"
Output: "I ate an apple"

Input: "She runs fast"
Output: "She ran fast"

Now convert: "They sing well"
```

### 4. Role-Based Prompting

Assigning specific roles to guide responses.

**What it is:**

- Defines AI's perspective
- Shapes tone and expertise level
- Creates focused responses

**Example:**

```
Act as a cybersecurity expert and explain how password hashing works to a beginner.
```

### 5. Prompt Reframing

Restructuring prompts for different perspectives.

**What it is:**

- Alternative ways to ask
- Explores different angles
- Improves response quality

**Example:**
Original: "What are solar panels?"
Reframed: "How would you explain solar panels to a 10-year-old?"

### 6. Prompt Combination

Merging multiple instructions for comprehensive responses.

**What it is:**

- Multiple questions in one
- Creates thorough responses
- Addresses complex topics

**Example:**

```
Explain what Python is, provide three key benefits of using it, and suggest
two beginner-friendly projects to start with.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**

   - Clear instructions get better results
   - Avoid vague or ambiguous language
   - State your expectations clearly

2. **Start Simple**

   - Begin with zero-shot prompting
   - Add complexity only when needed
   - Iterate based on results

3. **Test and Refine**
   - Try different approaches
   - Combine techniques when appropriate
   - Learn from successful prompts

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Overly complex instructions
- Ambiguous or vague requests
- Missing context when needed
- Inconsistent formatting
- Too many requirements at once

## Quick Reference Table

| Technique   | Best For               | Example Use Case       |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Zero-Shot   | Simple questions       | Factual queries        |
| One-Shot    | Format-specific tasks  | Content templates      |
| Few-Shot    | Pattern replication    | Language translation   |
| Role-Based  | Specialized knowledge  | Technical explanations |
| Reframing   | Different perspectives | Complex concepts       |
| Combination | Comprehensive answers  | Multi-part questions   |

Remember: The most effective technique depends on your specific needs. Start simple and add complexity only when necessary.
