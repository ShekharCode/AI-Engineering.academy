## Chain of Thought

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a sophisticated technique that enhances an AI model's ability to handle complex reasoning tasks. Think of it as showing your work in a math problem – instead of just providing the final answer, you demonstrate each step of your thinking process.

### Understanding CoT

When we use Chain-of-Thought prompting, we're asking the AI to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps. This approach leads to more accurate and logical outputs because it forces the model to "think" through each stage of the solution.

### Practical Example

```
Problem: A store has a 30% discount on all items. If Sarah buys a shirt
originally priced at $40 and pants originally priced at $60, how much
does she save in total?

Chain of Thought:
1. Calculate original total:
   Shirt ($40) + Pants ($60) = $100

2. Calculate discount percentage:
   30% of $100 = $100 × 0.30 = $30

Therefore, Sarah saves $30 in total.
```

### Advanced Usage: CoT Rollouts

CoT rollouts take this concept further by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given problem. Here's what makes them powerful:

1. **Self-consistency decoding**

   - Generate multiple solution paths
   - Compare the different approaches
   - Choose the most commonly reached conclusion

2. **Complexity-based evaluation**

   - Assess the depth of each reasoning chain
   - Consider the thoroughness of each approach
   - Select solutions with comprehensive reasoning

3. **Human validation integration**
   - Use human expertise when rollouts disagree
   - Validate critical decision points
   - Refine the reasoning process

## Self-Consistency

Self-consistency is an enhancement to Chain-of-Thought prompting that focuses on generating and evaluating multiple reasoning paths. This approach is particularly valuable when dealing with problems that have various valid solution methods.

### Key Components

The self-consistency approach involves:

1. Generating multiple independent solutions
2. Analyzing the consistency between different approaches
3. Identifying patterns in reasoning
4. Selecting the most reliable outcome

### Example Implementation

```
Question: Calculate 15% of 240

Path 1:
- 10% of 240 = 24
- 5% is half of 10% = 12
- Total: 24 + 12 = 36

Path 2:
- Convert 15% to decimal: 0.15
- Multiply: 240 × 0.15 = 36

Path 3:
- Break down into: (240 × 10/100) + (240 × 5/100)
- = 24 + 12
- = 36

All paths converge on 36, indicating high confidence in the answer.
```

## ReAct Prompting

ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) prompting is a synergistic approach that combines reasoning traces with specific actions. This technique allows AI models to dynamically plan, execute, and adjust their approach during complex problem-solving scenarios.

### Core Components

The ReAct framework consists of three main elements:

1. **Thought**: The model's internal reasoning process
2. **Action**: Specific tasks or queries to be performed
3. **Observation**: Results or information gathered from actions

### Comprehensive Example

```
Task: Find out who directed the highest-grossing film of 2009

1. Thought: I need to identify the highest-grossing film of 2009 first
2. Action: Search for "highest-grossing film 2009"
3. Observation: Avatar was the highest-grossing film of 2009

4. Thought: Now I need to find out who directed Avatar
5. Action: Search for "Avatar 2009 director"
6. Observation: James Cameron directed Avatar

7. Thought: I have all the necessary information
8. Answer: James Cameron directed Avatar, the highest-grossing film of 2009
```

### Applications

ReAct prompting excels in:

- Complex question answering
- Multi-step task automation

## ReAct Prompting Illustrated

ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) prompting is an advanced technique that combines reasoning traces and task-specific actions to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). This approach allows LLMs to generate verbal reasoning steps and perform actions in an interleaved manner, leading to more effective and dynamic problem-solving.

### A Typical ReAct Prompt

1. **Thought**: The model's reasoning process.
2. **Action**: A specific task or query to be performed.
3. **Observation**: The result or information obtained from the action.

#### Example

**Question**: What is the capital of the country where the Eiffel Tower is located?

1. **Thought**: To answer this question, I need to find out where the Eiffel Tower is located and then determine the capital of that country.
2. **Action**: Search for "Location of Eiffel Tower."
3. **Observation**: The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France.
4. **Thought**: Now that I know the Eiffel Tower is in France, I need to find out the capital of France.
5. **Action**: Search for "Capital of France."
6. **Observation**: The capital of France is Paris.
7. **Thought**: I have all the information needed to answer the question.
8. **Action**: Provide answer.
9. **Answer**: The capital of the country where the Eiffel Tower is located is Paris, France.

### Applications of ReAct Prompting
